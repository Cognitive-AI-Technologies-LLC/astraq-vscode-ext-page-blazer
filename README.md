# AstraQ TestDock – Your AI Testing Copilot in the IDE

TestDock is an AI-powered testing extension that helps you instantly record, replay, and validate your web app user flows — right from your IDE. With just a few clicks, you can capture real user interactions, run tests with screenshots, and let AI analyze every screen for issues. No scripts. No setup. Just test as you code.

## How It Works:
1. Record a Flow – Start recording user actions like clicks, inputs, and navigation.
2. Run the Flow – Replay tests on your app. Screenshots are taken at each step.
3. AI Validates – OpenAI checks each screen for missing buttons, broken layouts, error messages, etc.
4. Review Results – View passed/failed steps with visual proof and smart AI suggestions.
5. Fix Prompt - Developer can use the generated prompts to fix the issues by providing code context to the LLMs.  
6. Improve Quickly – Edit, re-run, or clone flows directly from your IDE.
